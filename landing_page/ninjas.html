    <h1>Rock lee</h1>
    <p> is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Lee clan and a member of Team Guy. 
        Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use ninjutsu or genjutsu. 
        However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training from Might Guy
         that would make him a taijutsu master while still a genin.</p>
